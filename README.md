This is a little project to simulate rolling a selected number of dice.
This is mostly to help brush off some dust in my Python knowledge.
Ths user enters a number of dice they want rolled and the face value of all of them is shown along with the total.  
As all dice are assumed to have 6 sides, a future enhancement would be to allow dice with a different number of sides. I
believe multi-sided dice are usually used by themselves however so this would then just become "choose a number between
1 and n" in order to work.
